            <p>This song was originally recorded by Zhenyue Zhang.
                His vocal sounds young and pure. I think his voice is full of energy.
                This song tells that we often have to face a lot of choices and make a "right" decision in life, even though sometimes we don't want to.
                I have also made a lot of choices actively and passively in my life. 
                I am always anxious before choosing, but I will also work hard after choosing and look forward to good results.
