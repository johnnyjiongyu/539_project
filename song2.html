            <p>This song was first recorded by Teresa Teng and released in 1971. 
                Although this song was released more than 50 years, it travels through time.
                Moreover, Teresa Teng is the most famous singer in China. She is equivalent to a Chinese culture.
            </p></br>
            <p>This song tells that someone is willing to use their life and all strength to cherish another person. 
                This person could be your family members, your partner, or your friends. 
                Whenever I listen to this song, I feel like I've traveled culturally and emotionally.
