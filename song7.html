            <h1>The Edge</h1>
            <p>
                This song was first recorded by Cheer Chan. The title and lyrics were very philosophical.
                The direct translation of the title of this song is "Fish", but she translated it as "The Edge".
                She compares leaves to fish. This song is about choices, as the title suggests.
                We make different choices at various edges in life, just like fish choose the ocean and leaves choose the sky.
            </p></br>
            <p>I saw her performance in a music festival in the summer of 2023. 
                She was very emotional that night, and so was I.
                This song was the last one she sang, and she cried, so the audience helped her finish the song. 
                It was an amazing night and took me several days to calm down.</p>
