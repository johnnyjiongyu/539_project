            <p>This song was originally recorded by Stefanie Sun. 
                It was also the first song in her career.
                It tells a story of a young person who leaves home to struggle in the outside world, thinking she can do anything for love.
                But in the end, she discovers that adult life is also full of regrets and setbacks.
                Although this is a Mandarin song, it includes two lines of a Minnan (Southern Min language) nursery rhyme.
                The reason for only two lines is that the young person has been away from home for so long that she has forgotten how to sing the rest. 
                At the end of the song, Sun sings, "I really want to go home now."
            </p></br>
            <p>I don't remember the first time I heard this song, but it feels like it has always been in my memory. 
                I found many of my Chinese friends have heard this song.
                We all dreamed big when we left home, but we only realized that how much our family protected us after we left.
