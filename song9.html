                This song was originally recorded by Sandee Chan. I was shocked the first time I heard this song.
                Both the melody and the lyrics are abstract and gave me goosebumps.
                The lyrics were written by a poet Yu Xia. The song, lasting eight minutes, narrates many scenes. 
                For example, it satirizes how people always try to find profound meanings in superficial things. 
                It also portrays how brutal rulers can go home and gently have dinner.
                I still don't feel that I fully understand this song, but the impact it has had on me is unforgettable.
