            <h1>Analysis of the Michigan Municipalities on Collecting, Analyzing, and Sharing of Water Infrastructure Data</h1>
            <h2>Project Information</h2>
            <p><strong>Overview</strong>:
                Our group studied the challenges faced by municipalities in Michigan in gathering, standardizing, and sharing data among each other. 
                We did literature review and conducted interviews with some stakeholders in local water organizations. 
                Following this, we analyzed all the data, got results, and summarized them in a report.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Project Type</strong>: Group Work in the course of SI 501 - Contextual Inquiry and Consulting Foundations</p>
            <p><strong>Group Members</strong>: Johnny Chen, Dawn Zeng, Jonanthan McMillan, Aishah Al-Mohamedi, Piano Endo</p>
            <p><strong>Duration</strong>: 9/2023-12/2023</p>
            <p><strong>Skills</strong>: Qualitative Research, Miro, Affinity Work, Google Products</p>

        <div class="content_2">
            <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
            <p>Michigan currently lacks a way to review data on the status and quality of water infrastructure from multiple municipalities simultaneously (Lupher, Schneider, and Dennis 3). 
                There exists no standardization between municipalities in the way water infrastructure quality is recorded and reported, 
                resulting in many unknowns and lost information when attempting to investigate quality at scale (Lupher, Schneider, and Dennis 16).
            </p></br>

            <p>
                Municipalities do not appear privy to communicate effectively with each other on the subject, 
                and it is thought that the longer these issues persist, the quicker Michigan's water infrastructure deteriorates 
                (Lupher, Schneider, and Dennis 17).
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="content_2">
            <h2>Process</h2>
            <p>
                1. To find enough evidence to support our problem statement to be worth investigating and to better identify what current issues are severe, 
                we first did some research on Google Scholar and various water websites.
                We created a Google Sheet to record all the information we found and summarize what results are the same.
            </p></br>

            <p>
                2.Besides, each member of our group selected a SME video interview and did analysis on it. 
                We shared what we found in those video interviews and saw which ideas were relevant to aging water infrastructure and our research question.
            </p></br>

            <p>
                3. In order to obtain more firsthand information, we conducted interviews with various stakeholders. 
                We finished an interview protocol so we could ask questions in a more logical way in the interview.
            </p></br>

            <p>
                4. After we collected all of the data from various parties, we started working on our affinity wall on Miro. 
                We extracted the core ideas from different sources and summarized them in one sentence, then wrote these on yellow sticky notes. 
                After that, we roughly categorized them. Next, we went over and discussed whether each categorization is reasonable together, and made adjustments accordingly. 
                We wrote a sentence to summarize each category on a blue sticky note. 
                Then we conducted the second categorization and used pink sticky notes to summarize them. 
                Finally, we divided pink sticky notes into two parts and used green sticky notes to mark their differences.

            <h2>Findings/Insights</h2>
            <p>
                One surprising finding is that Michigan is actually doing better than other states in some aspects. 
                They have developed a program to ensure that data can be entered in the same way, which enhances data standardization and facilitates sharing by municipalities.
            </p>

        <div class="content_2">
            <h2>Next Steps</h2>
            <p>
                For our next steps, we would need to interview more stakeholders. Our two interviewees expressed conflicting opinions, 
                so we would need to speak to more people to clarify solutions and figure out what factors contribute to the differing views.
