            <h1>Through Our Lives</h1>
            <p>
                This song was first recorded by Deserts Chang (Anpu).
                The style of this song is very peaceful, giving a feeling of Buddhism.
                Chang mentioned many questions in the lyrics, all about life and fate. 
                For example, how can we forgive ourselves for trying but getting nothing?
                How should we forgive the process of time passing? How should we think without asking?
            </p></br>
            <p>Simply put, this is the most important song of my life. 
                About the melody of this song, every time I listen to it when I'm upset or under pressure, I find great relief. 
                About the lyrics, I don't know how to answer the questions in the lyrics. 
                But realizing that there are many people in the world who are also confused about these questions, 
                and even about their own lives, is a kind of comfort.
                Each of us will continue to live in our own way, and then we will find our own satisfactory answers.
