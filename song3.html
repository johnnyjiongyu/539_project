            <p>This song was originally recorded and released by Leslie Cheung, who was a Hong Kong singer.</p></br>
            <p>The first time I heard this song was covered by Kit Chan, who is a well-known Singapore singer.
                I was about fourteen years old at that time. I sat in front of the TV and was fascinated by her performance. 
                Despite all these years, I still think it's the most beautiful voice I've ever heard.
